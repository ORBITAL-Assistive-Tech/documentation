# Refreshable Braille Display

## Project Details
* We're creating a Braille e-reader (pretty much Braille Kindle)
* Why? Existing e-readers are not affordable or user-friendly
* Partnering with Perkins School for the Blind to conduct user research 
* Producing a device combining mechanical, electrical and software systems
* Aiming to make a meaningful positive impact on peopleâ€™s lives and education

## Our Sub-Teams
**Electromechanical Actuation**

Develop the electromechanical system(s) that will raise and lower the braille dots in each braille cell, prototype manufacturing processes to produce components at a small scale

**Firmware and Circuit Design**

Develop circuit boards for individual actuators and full system circuit board, design compact boards for ease of installation and maintenance. 

**Software and Embedded Systems**

Create custom software to convert specific files into braille ready format

**User Experience Design**

Take technical developments to potential users for feedback, synthesize feedback into design requirements
