I reasoned that it made no sense to remake the wheel when there were clear instructions of what could be done. This gave me a really jumping off point to begin designing off of. Key features that I noticed were rounded corners and edges, sleek top designs, and many included items such as an attachable lanyard. Based on these features, I began sketching what a model could look like. Initially I was thinking something a bit clunkier than my final as I didn\u2019t (and still don\u2019t) really know how large the actuation components would be nor how much space our electrical system would be. From speaking to Toby, I was given the guidance that skinnier is better, as we would like this to be an easily transportable device. Something that could easily be slipped into a backpack. From here, I slimmed down the design, but left the main components the same. </p> <p>I designed off the plan of using a 12 by 40 cell array. This informed the sizing of the unit. I alo planned for the case to be at least two parts. I felt that having a top and bottom component that could be separated would be optimal for repairs and cleanings. Ideally, I would like for this to be something that clicks into place rather than using screws, but this might be the better route to take when thinking of durability.</p> <p>A challenge I ran into when designing this/creating an MVP was material usage. For the curved and sleek design I was going for, using cardboard or hardboard wasn\u2019t necessarily going to be my best bet, but I also didn\u2019t want to use the 3D printers to create something that was likely not going to be used beyond the design review. Also the size of the case exceeds the max capacity of most of the tools I know how to use, but this made me think about how we can make portions of this in a modular way. This is why I really only cut the top board as a visual representation for the team to recognize how limited our space will be working at a standard braille sizing.</p> <p>Going into the next sprint, I do still have some questions I would like to look into</p> <ul> <li>What would be our ideal way to manufacture our case?</li> <li>When someone is using our e-reader how are we expecting them to use it? In their lap or on a table?</li> <li>What kinds of buttons and ports do we think we\u2019ll be using? How can we arrange them in a logical way to make the e-reader more intuitive?</li> <li>Are there ways I can design the case to help orient the user?</li> <li>Are there ideal weight guidelines to be within for a handheld device such as this?</li> </ul>"},{"location":"sprint_1/#key-takeaways","title":"Key Takeaways","text":"<ul> <li>I enjoyed the autonomy I felt that I had while working on this project.

The three criterias to select our architecture are (1) modularity, (2) ease-of-testing, and (3) light-weight. The first criteria arose due to the fact that for the first two sprints, we will be developing software without a physical user-interface. Therefore, we have to make code that isn\u2019t rigidly connected to the architecture, allowing us to move it to another ecosystem when the hardware components are ready to be integrated. For the second criteria, without a physical user-interface, we decided to proceed with a digital twin of the expected final physical user-interface. This allows us to test how our functions will interact with the actual device. The limitation is that it will always be a digital imitation. We won\u2019t be able to intuitively understand how the physical product would function. But it is the best imitation we can make without a physical user-interface. For backend-heavy functions, we will create unit tests to examine a breadth of possible scenarios. As for the last criteria, the software will probably be running on a microcomputer with 1 to 2 GB of RAM. Furthermore, we will not have lots of storage space\u2013 up to about 8 GB (which is more than enough). Thus, the architecture must not be too complex and involve too many layers. With the criterias in mind, we selected the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. </p> <p>In terms of modularity, this architecture allows us to split our code into three different parts that do not heavily rely on each other. The Model portion is where we will define the structure of the data that we will be using. The Controller portion is where the \u201cthinking\u201d happens. It includes functions that will manipulate the data stored in the model, interact with the View, and connect the data from the Model to the View. The View portion is strictly the user-interface. In the next two sprints, our View will be digital. However, as we move into the integration phase with other subteams, the View will change into the physical product. The MVC allows us to focus on developing the essential code that we need in the Model and Controller, and have as little of what we need in the View. We can simply then replace the digital version of the View with the physical version of the View, while keeping all our progress in the Model and Controller. </p> <p>With regards to testing, the MVC architecture allows us to test two different types of Controller functions: the backend functions and the frontend functions. The backend functions are those that will strictly work in the background, for eg. converting a text file into braille format. Since all of these functions will be in the Controller portion, we can easily organize and create unit tests for them. The frontend functions are those that interact with the View. Our plan is to create functions in the View that are universal to both the digital and physical versions, for eg. nextPage(). In the digital version, this could manifest as a button that says next. In the physical version, this could be a button with braille dots on them. Either way, when the function is called, it will call a Controller function. We can then see if the Controller is doing what it\u2019s supposed to do, such as going to the next page of text/braille. The limitation to this method is that it would be painstaking to test all scenarios and not as efficient as unit testing, leading to possible bugs. To compensate, we will try to test as many things using unit tests as possible.</p>"},{"location":"sprint_1/#workflow","title":"Workflow","text":"<p>For this sprint, we will be working in two smaller teams: frontend and backend. The frontend team is in charge of developing the digital user-interface. The backend team is in charge of developing functions in the Controller that take in .txt files and turn them into braille format. As the backend team develops their functions, they will also shape the Model in whatever ways they deem fit.</p> <p>All of our code is on the software repository of the ORBITAL-Assistive-Tech Github organization. The repository has three branches: main, test_ui, and upload. The main branch includes the most up-to-date code that is reflective of the whole sub team's current progress. For this sprint, the main branch includes code that will start up a digital user-interface with buttons that the user can interact with. Buttons are mapped to functions in the Controller that interacts with the Model. The other two branches are for developing new features. The frontend team works on the test_ui branch. This branch includes the most up-to-date version of the digital user-interface. The backend team works on the upload branch. This branch includes the most up-to-date version of the Controller and Model.</p> <p>When one of the teams feel like their work is complete, they can submit a pull request in which the sub team lead can accept/reject.

We did not initially settle on a fixed design for the Model as we believed that there will be new information that\u2019ll have to be stored as the project proceeds. However, we did decide on an overall guiding structure.</p> <p>To represent the braille e-reader itself, we created a class named Reader which stores all information concerning the operation of the device, such as its battery percentage, current selected document, etc. The Reader class also has a variable named \u201cdocuments\u201d which is a list containing all of the books, documents, and articles that have been uploaded to the device.</p> <p>To represent each of these books, documents, and articles, we created a class named BrailleFile. The class contains the text of the document, the text\u2019s braille equivalent, the file path of the original file to the program, and a unique ID which is used to select/identify the file. Whenever a file is uploaded, the Controller will parse it and store the parsed information into an instance of the BrailleFile class. The instance is then stored in the Reader\u2019s \u201cdocuments\u201d variable.</p> <p>As the project goes on, we aim to add more variables to these classes as we incorporate new features into the device. Possible ideas we are looking into are ways to represent chapters and book sections in the BrailleFile class, and storing the most recent location the reader was at \u2013 so they don\u2019t have to start all over from the beginning of the document. The Reader class could store certain information on preferred settings or some kind of history that the user might find helpful.

I reasoned that it made no sense to remake the wheel when there were clear instructions of what could be done. This gave me a really jumping off point to begin designing off of. Key features that I noticed were rounded corners and edges, sleek top designs, and many included items such as an attachable lanyard. Based on these features, I began sketching what a model could look like. Initially I was thinking something a bit clunkier than my final as I didn\u2019t (and still don\u2019t) really know how large the actuation components would be nor how much space our electrical system would be. From speaking to Toby, I was given the guidance that skinnier is better, as we would like this to be an easily transportable device. Something that could easily be slipped into a backpack. From here, I slimmed down the design, but left the main components the same. </p> <p>I designed off the plan of using a 12 by 40 cell array. This informed the sizing of the unit. I alo planned for the case to be at least two parts. I felt that having a top and bottom component that could be separated would be optimal for repairs and cleanings. Ideally, I would like for this to be something that clicks into place rather than using screws, but this might be the better route to take when thinking of durability.</p> <p>A challenge I ran into when designing this/creating an MVP was material usage. For the curved and sleek design I was going for, using cardboard or hardboard wasn\u2019t necessarily going to be my best bet, but I also didn\u2019t want to use the 3D printers to create something that was likely not going to be used beyond the design review. Also the size of the case exceeds the max capacity of most of the tools I know how to use, but this made me think about how we can make portions of this in a modular way. This is why I really only cut the top board as a visual representation for the team to recognize how limited our space will be working at a standard braille sizing.</p> <p>Going into the next sprint, I do still have some questions I would like to look into</p> <ul> <li>What would be our ideal way to manufacture our case?</li> <li>When someone is using our e-reader how are we expecting them to use it? In their lap or on a table?</li> <li>What kinds of buttons and ports do we think we\u2019ll be using?

The three criterias to select our architecture are (1) modularity, (2) ease-of-testing, and (3) light-weight. The first criteria arose due to the fact that for the first two sprints, we will be developing software without a physical user-interface. Therefore, we have to make code that isn\u2019t rigidly connected to the architecture, allowing us to move it to another ecosystem when the hardware components are ready to be integrated. For the second criteria, without a physical user-interface, we decided to proceed with a digital twin of the expected final physical user-interface. This allows us to test how our functions will interact with the actual device. The limitation is that it will always be a digital imitation. We won\u2019t be able to intuitively understand how the physical product would function. But it is the best imitation we can make without a physical user-interface. For backend-heavy functions, we will create unit tests to examine a breadth of possible scenarios. As for the last criteria, the software will probably be running on a microcomputer with 1 to 2 GB of RAM. Furthermore, we will not have lots of storage space\u2013 up to about 8 GB (which is more than enough). Thus, the architecture must not be too complex and involve too many layers. With the criterias in mind, we selected the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. </p> <p>In terms of modularity, this architecture allows us to split our code into three different parts that do not heavily rely on each other. The Model portion is where we will define the structure of the data that we will be using. The Controller portion is where the \u201cthinking\u201d happens. It includes functions that will manipulate the data stored in the model, interact with the View, and connect the data from the Model to the View. The View portion is strictly the user-interface. In the next two sprints, our View will be digital. However, as we move into the integration phase with other subteams, the View will change into the physical product. The MVC allows us to focus on developing the essential code that we need in the Model and Controller, and have as little of what we need in the View. We can simply then replace the digital version of the View with the physical version of the View, while keeping all our progress in the Model and Controller. </p> <p>With regards to testing, the MVC architecture allows us to test two different types of Controller functions: the backend functions and the frontend functions. The backend functions are those that will strictly work in the background, for eg. converting a text file into braille format. Since all of these functions will be in the Controller portion, we can easily organize and create unit tests for them. The frontend functions are those that interact with the View. Our plan is to create functions in the View that are universal to both the digital and physical versions, for eg. nextPage(). In the digital version, this could manifest as a button that says next. In the physical version, this could be a button with braille dots on them. Either way, when the function is called, it will call a Controller function. We can then see if the Controller is doing what it\u2019s supposed to do, such as going to the next page of text/braille. The limitation to this method is that it would be painstaking to test all scenarios and not as efficient as unit testing, leading to possible bugs. To compensate, we will try to test as many things using unit tests as possible.</p>"},{"location":"sprint_1_teams/software/#workflow","title":"Workflow","text":"<p>For this sprint, we will be working in two smaller teams: frontend and backend. The frontend team is in charge of developing the digital user-interface. The backend team is in charge of developing functions in the Controller that take in .txt files and turn them into braille format. As the backend team develops their functions, they will also shape the Model in whatever ways they deem fit.</p> <p>All of our code is on the software repository of the ORBITAL-Assistive-Tech Github organization. The repository has three branches: main, test_ui, and upload. The main branch includes the most up-to-date code that is reflective of the whole sub team's current progress. For this sprint, the main branch includes code that will start up a digital user-interface with buttons that the user can interact with. Buttons are mapped to functions in the Controller that interacts with the Model. The other two branches are for developing new features. The frontend team works on the test_ui branch. This branch includes the most up-to-date version of the digital user-interface. The backend team works on the upload branch. This branch includes the most up-to-date version of the Controller and Model.</p> <p>When one of the teams feel like their work is complete, they can submit a pull request in which the sub team lead can accept/reject.

We did not initially settle on a fixed design for the Model as we believed that there will be new information that\u2019ll have to be stored as the project proceeds. However, we did decide on an overall guiding structure.</p> <p>To represent the braille e-reader itself, we created a class named Reader which stores all information concerning the operation of the device, such as its battery percentage, current selected document, etc. The Reader class also has a variable named \u201cdocuments\u201d which is a list containing all of the books, documents, and articles that have been uploaded to the device.</p> <p>To represent each of these books, documents, and articles, we created a class named BrailleFile. The class contains the text of the document, the text\u2019s braille equivalent, the file path of the original file to the program, and a unique ID which is used to select/identify the file. Whenever a file is uploaded, the Controller will parse it and store the parsed information into an instance of the BrailleFile class. The instance is then stored in the Reader\u2019s \u201cdocuments\u201d variable.</p> <p>As the project goes on, we aim to add more variables to these classes as we incorporate new features into the device. Possible ideas we are looking into are ways to represent chapters and book sections in the BrailleFile class, and storing the most recent location the reader was at \u2013 so they don\u2019t have to start all over from the beginning of the document. The Reader class could store certain information on preferred settings or some kind of history that the user might find helpful.
